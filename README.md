Social Science Data-Merger Incorporating data from the U.S. Census, Project Implicit and the Opportunity Index

Racial inequality remains ubiquitous throughout the United States and is increasing on numerous metrics. Black Americans have lower incomes than White Americans in 99% of Census tracts (Chetty et al., 2018). The median net worth of White Americans in 1983 was $86,500 higher than that of BlackAmericans. By 2013, this difference rose to $133,000 (Stepler, 2016).Yet, it remains unknown how growing up within this context of racial inequality shapes the way children think about race, and how variation in the degree of racial inequality within a neighborhood might developmentally predict the emergence of racial bias.The aim of this project is to identify how childrenâ€™s racial biases are influenced by the racial inequalities present in their local neighborhoods. We examine this question by longitudinally analyzing the racial attitudes of children and parents living in communities from across the United States and by modeling racial inequalities across several domains (e.g., economic, educational, health, and environmental)

Since its inception, the app has evolved into a tool that would allow social scientists to murge study data with other data sources (The U.S. Census, Project Implicit and the Opportunity Index). The App is designed with Dash in Python and hosted on Heroku.
